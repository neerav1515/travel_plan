This project is inspired from a Data structures and algorithm problem of finding minimum distance from source to distance using at maximum one plane .

The main solution revolves around Dijkstra's algorithm.(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm#:~:text=Dijkstra's%20algorithm%20(or%20Dijkstra's%20Shortest,and%20published%20three%20years%20later.)

Graphs are implemented in javascript from scratch and visualised using vis.js library.

The easier version of the problem involves just finding minimum distance from source to destination without any constraints on number of planes used .
